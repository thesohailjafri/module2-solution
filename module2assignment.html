                <i>//Mumbai is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra.</i>
                <br>
                <br> Located on Maharashtra’s coast, Mumbai is India’s most-populous city, and it is one of the largest and most densely populated urban areas in the world. It was built on a site of ancient settlement, and it took its name from the local
                goddess Mumba—a form of Parvati, the consort of Shiva, one of the principal deities of Hinduism—whose temple once stood in what is now the southeastern section of the city. It became known as Bombay during the British colonial period,
                the name possibly an Anglicized corruption of Mumbai or perhaps of Bom Baim (“Good Harbour”), supposedly a Portuguese name for the locale.

                <br>
                <br> Gandhinagar was named for Mohandas K. Gandhi, leader of the Indian nationalist movement. Built to supplant Ahmadabad as capital, the city was begun in 1966. State government offices were transferred to Gandhinagar in 1970, and the
                city subsequently became a commercial and cultural centre in Gujarat. An expressway connects Gandhinagar with Ahmadabad.
